        "description": "\nNewly remastered and beautifully restored. \u00a0First time on Blu-ray.\nAll Joe Sullivan wants is \u201ca breath of fresh air.\u201d But when you\u2019re serving time in stir for robbery, fresh air is a rare commodity. That\u2019s about to change though as mob boss Rick Coyle has greased the skids inside the prison walls, so Joe can make it outside where girlfriend Pat will be waiting.\u00a0 But things don\u2019t exactly go as planned for the duo as car trouble during their getaway forces them to get help from the only person nearby -- strait-laced legal assistant Ann Martin, whom they kidnap and use to evade capture. Things aren\u2019t going as planned for Rick either who set up the escape fully expecting the fugitive to get \u201ccut down\u201d so he could keep the $50,000 he owes Joe for taking the rap for him.\nNow past the dragnet, the trio each find themselves increasingly conflicted in their loyalties and core beliefs as Joe is torn between the two women, who both care for him, while Pat and Ann each make decisions that prove they\u2019re not as bad, or as good, as they\u2019re supposed to be.\u00a0 Raw Deal presents the moviemaking team of director Anthony Mann and cinematographer John Alton at the peak of their success (fresh off their box office smash T-Men), offering dark, moody atmosphere filled with fog-shrouded landscapes and characters who are no strangers to the \u201cleft-handed endeavor\u201d of crime. Scenarist John C. Higgins (He Walked by Night) and co-writer Leopold Atlas offer a taut, suspenseful tale of one man\u2019s desperate bid for freedom and the two women who love him.\nDennis O\u2019Keefe, star of the earlier T-Men, contributes a first-rate performance as the determined Joe, with Marsha Hunt (Pride and Prejudice) as Ann and Oscar\u00ae winning actress Claire Trevor (Key Largo) as the fiercely loyal Pat. Raw Deal also features a suitably slimy Raymond Burr as Rick, John Ireland as Burr\u2019s sadistic henchman Fantail, and noir standbys Regis Toomey and Whit Bissell. Raw Deal is film noir at its finest!\n",

        "description": "A lost gem rediscovered! Thanks to the efforts of the Film Noir Foundation, this terrific 1950 film noir, the only American print of which was burned in a 2008 fire, has been rescued and restored to its original luster. Join the wild chase around San Francisco as a man goes into hiding after witnessing a gangland execution. Police bird-dog his wife Eleanor (Ann Sheridan), certain she\u2019ll lead them to her husband, whose testimony against the killer could bring down a crime kingpin. But Eleanor and her hubbie are Splitsville\u2014she never wants to see him again. When roguish newspaperman Danny Leggett (Dennis O\u2019Keefe) charms Eleanor into helping him track down the hidden husband\u2014there are unexpected, stunning, and poignant results. This nervy, shot-on-location thriller is a witty and wise look at the travails of romance and marriage, and perhaps the best cinematic depiction ever of mid-20th century San Francisco. Flicker Alley is honored to present this world-premiere Blu-ray/DVD dual-format edition of Woman on the Run, completely restored by the Film Noir Foundation in conjunction with UCLA Film & Television Archive, with special thanks to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association\u2019s Charitable Grant Trust and the British Film Institute. Together with Too Late for Tears this film marks the first collaboration between Flicker Alley and the Film Noir Foundation.",
