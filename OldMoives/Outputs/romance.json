In addition to Fairbanks's unique talent, these ebullient films showcase his gifted collaborators including writer Anita Loos and directors Allan Dwan, Victor Fleming, and John Emerson.\nDouglas Fairbanks came from Broadway to the movies in 1915 when high salaries were luring well-known stage actors to the new feature-length pictures. Although most of these performers failed to \u201cregister\u201d on camera and returned to New York, Fairbanks quickly became a supernova. His energetic, optimistic character, his ingratiating smile, his graceful, acrobatic stunts (he did his own), clever writing, and accomplished staging rapidly made Fairbanks one of the most admired stars in the world.\nDouglas Fairbanks: A Modern Musketeer begins with 4 films from 1916 by Triangle-Fine Arts: His Picture in the Papers, The Mystery of the Leaping Fish, Flirting With Fate, and The Matrimaniac. The collection continues with 3 films produced by Fairbanks for Artcraft/Famous Players-Lasky Corp.: Wild and Woolly (1917), Reaching for the Moon (1917), and A Modern Musketeer (1918). The last are 4 features Fairbanks produced for United Artists, a company he established in 1917 with Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford and D. W. Griffith: When the Clouds Roll By (1919), The Mollycoddle (1920), The Mark of Zorro (1920), and The Nut (1921).\"\n",

Flicker Alley, in partnership with the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Foundation is proud to present, Phantom. Featuring a magnificent new orchestral score by Robert Israel, this powerfully expressive and surprisingly insightful film is a triumph of German Weimar cinema and a wonderful collaboration of many of its most skilled artisans and recognizable performers. Through dazzling visuals and memorable characters, Phantom paints a portrait of the corrupting influence of money, the conformity of societal norms, and the redemptive power of family.\"",

The 10-episode Films Albatros serial is a six-and-a-half-hour epic of stylish elegance and narrative imagination.\nOn DVD for the 1st time in this 3-Disc DVD Edition!\nSerial films, or cin\u00e9 romans were well-established in France before World War I where they are most closely identified with writer-director Louis Feuillade. These melodramas for adult audiences were unlike American serials that were targeted primarily at youngsters. At Albatros, Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 producer Joseph Ermolieff produced three serials in 1921, all adapted from roman-feuilletons by the phenomenally successful Jules Mary, a specialist in the genre, who penned many a famous melodrama around the theme of the miscarriage of justice - a theme that must have had special appeal for the unjustly displaced technicians and artists of Ermolieff's Moscow and Yalta studios.\nThe first two serials have not left a trace in the annals of film archives. But The House of Mystery (La Maison du myst\u00e8re), Ermolieff's third serial, (begun in the summer of 1921 and not completed until 1923) by Alexandre Volkoff (with fellow studio director Viatcheslav Tourjansky providing some important and uncredited second-unit work), is a triumph of the genre and a complete delight that not only survived, but also was restored in its original ten-episode format by the Cinematheque Francaise. Flicker Alley and the Blackhawk Films\u00ae Collection are proud to present for the first time on DVD this six-and-a-half-hour epic of stylish elegance and narrative imagination, with optional English subtitles by Lenny Borger and a brand-new score by composer Neil Brand.\nThe involved plot of La Maison du myst\u00e8re centers around Julien Villandrit (Ivan Mosjoukine) and his star-crossed courtship to R\u00e9gine de Bettigny (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darly), that inspires bitterness and jealousy in Henri Corradin (Charles Vanel), Julien's long-time associate and secret rival in love. For Mosjoukine, who contracted typhoid fever during the course of production, it remains one of the ultimate consecrations to his multifarious talents as actor, writer, and even make-up artist. But the film also opened doors for Vanel (Les Mis\u00e9rables, The Wages of Fear, Diabolique) who gives the \"\"Curses! Foiled again!\"\" school of melodramatic villainy a new lease on life), and the astonishing Nicolas Koline.\n",

Julie consents, but after two long years and without a wedding date in sight, she meets and impulsively marries Michael, a charismatic writer.\n\u00a0\nHowever, Julie soon finds out that her new husband (Alan Marshal) is a loafer who is more interested in partying than supporting his family. Things then go from bad to worse when Michael is accidentally killed (at a party), leaving Julie and her daughter penniless and stranded in Paris.\n\u00a0\nBut her Aunt William (Dame May Whitty) hasn\u2019t given up hope that Julie could rekindle her romance with Ives and provides her with enough money to come back home to Vermont. Will Julie\u2019s arrival be enough to blunt the attentions of a young co-ed (Louise Platt) who has intentions of marrying Ives herself?\u00a0Producer Walter Wanger brought Allene Corliss\u2019 novel Summer Lightning to the big screen in 1938 as I Met My Love Again, directed by Arthur Ripley and Joshua Logan.\u00a0 It would be the motion picture debut for Logan, a celebrated stage director (whose early theatrical productions starred Fonda and his pal James Stewart) who wouldn\u2019t receive credit on another film until 1955. \u00a0I Met My Love Again also served as the cinematic debut of actress Louise Platt (whom Wanger would later cast in Stagecoach), in addition to offering an excellent showcase for such favorites such as Dame May Whitty and a young Tim Holt.

Though she is returned a year later, Laila grows into a young woman of two worlds, at home with both her settled and nomadic upbringings. Laila soon finds herself in a love triangle with her foster brother Mellet (Henry Gleditsch) and her cousin Anders (Harald Schwenzen), played out against the backdrop of an encroaching plague. Expertly photographed with a shockingly modern cinematic flair, Laila goes from snowy mountain-tops to lush green valleys, featuring treacherous waterfalls, packs of rampaging wolves and reindeer-pulled sled chases.\nRecently resurrected by and proudly presented in conjunction with the Norwegian Film Institute, Laila boasts a restored transfer and all-new subtitles as well as a brand new theater organ score by renowned composer Robert Israel.\"\n",
