In 1957, legendary Hal Roach Studios brought the comic strip couple to the small screen with Pamela Britton as Blondie and Lake reprising his role as Dagwood\u2026 a role he seemed born to play.\nA delightful 1950s sitcom that perfectly captures the jovial domestic spirit of the strip, Blondie also stars Stuffy Singer and Ann Barnes as the Bumstead children (Alexander, formerly Baby Dumpling, and Cookie).

These editions feature all-new musical settings by outstanding practitioners of silent film accompaniment Eric Beheim, Neil Brand, Antonio Coppola, Frederick Hodges, Stephen Horne, Robert Israel, Rodney Sauer and The Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Ethan Uslan, and Ken Winokur's band Tillie\u2019s Nightmare with the UCLA Film and Television Archive restoration of Tillie's Punctured Romance.\nCharles Chaplin came to Mack Sennett\u2019s Keystone Studios late in 1913 as a little-known British vaudevillian, and after a year, had not only established his Tramp character, learned to write and direct his own films, and also achieved public recognition as a star comedian. Although Keystone did not publicize its performers by name, standees of Chaplin's likeness outside theatres sufficed to attract audiences. Some of the films, especially Tillie's Punctured Romance, remained in theatrical distribution for decades. The fact that all but one of the Chaplin Keystones exist is due, of course, to the star\u2019s enormous subsequent popularity. Most of the original Keystone negatives, however, were simply printed away and the survival of all but a few of these films depends upon a very few original prints, a larger number of reissue prints, and some duped prints from later years. With the support of Association Chaplin (Paris), 35mm full aperture, early-generation materials were gathered over an eight year search on almost all the films from archives and collectors around the world, and were painstakingly pieced together and restored by the British Film Institute National Archive, the Cineteca Bologna and its laboratory L\u2019Immagine Ritrovata in Italy, and Lobster Films in Paris. Most are now clear, sharp and rock-steady, although some reveal that their source prints are well-used and a handful survives only in 16mm. One can now understand Chaplin's meteoric rise, for it is possible for the first time in generations to see clearly what clever and imaginative films he made at Keystone.\"\n",

For pioneering movie producer Hal Roach, however, \u201cstreamliner\u201d had an entirely different meaning.\u00a0 The man whose film studio was known as the \u201cLot of Fun\u201d saw a changing landscape in the picture business in the late 1930s and came up with the idea of producing features with shorter run times to accommodate movie houses, as well as cut production costs. The concept would prove successful with 22 streamliners being produced by the studio between 1941 and 1948.\u00a0 Hal Roach premiered his first streamliner in September of 1941: Tanks a Million, a military comedy that teamed William Tracy and Joe Sawyer as catastrophe-prone dogfaces. The popular duo would star in five more service romps for Roach, Hay Foot (1942), About Face (1942), Fall In (1943), Yanks Ahoy (1943) and the Cinecolor produced Here Comes Trouble (1948) -- which was remastered in color from a 35mm print exclusively for this set.\n\u00a0\nThis special six film collection is a must-have for any fan of Hal Roach with each film culled from the original Hal Roach Studio masters. Featured players include James Gleason, Margaret Dumont, Noah Beery, Jr., Douglas Fowley, Elyse Knox, Frank Faylen, Jean Porter, Marjorie Lord, Veda Ann Borg, Charles Lane, Betty Compson and Joan Woodbury.\n\u00a0\nTanks a Million (1941, 50 min.)When Dorian \u201cDodo\u201d Doubleday gets drafted into the Army, his photographic memory quickly gets him promoted to sergeant, much to the dismay of all those around him, especially Sergeant Ames.\nThis delightful first entry of the series co-stars James Gleason and Noah Beery, Jr., and features many other familiar faces including Douglas Fowley, Elyse Knox, Frank Faylen and Dick Wessel.\n\u00a0\nHay Foot (1942, 47 min.)The hilarity continues at Camp Carver as Colonel Barkley mistakes Dodo as an expert marksman, and plans to teach braggarts Ames and Cobb a lesson via his newfound \u201cbest shot in the Army\u201d.\nThe team of Tracy and Sawyer is solidified in this second installment of the series as both actors receive top billing. Featured players include James Gleason returning as Col. Barkley, Noah Beery, Jr. (now Sgt. Cobb), Elyse Knox, who is now Betty Barkley (the colonel's daughter) and Douglas Fowley.\n\u00a0\nAbout Face (1942, 44 min.)Wanting to paint the town, a broke Sergeant Ames suddenly becomes Doubleday\u2019s pal when he learns that Dodo has just won a wad of cash in a radio contest.\nAlong for the ride are a bevy of featured players including Jean Porter, Marjorie Lord, Margaret Dumont, Veda Ann Borg, Charles Lane, Frank Faylen and Dick Wessel (both now bartenders). Also spotted in brief roles are Mike Mazurki, Rebel Randall, Pat Flaherty and Ralph Dunn.\n\u00a0\nFall In (1943, 48 min.)Dodo is up for a promotion and Ames is out to prove that he\u2019s the better man, but they soon join forces as a spy ring is discovered right under their noses.\nJean Porter is back, but now as love interest Joan, while Frank Faylen plays his third different role in the series, this time as Captain Gillis (a last name he would later don in the popular TV series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis). Also featured are Rebel Randall, Arthur Hunnicutt and Tom Fadden.\n\u00a0\nYanks Ahoy (1943, 59 min.)Called to special duty overseas, Dodo and Ames board a naval vessel and soon learn of a saboteur\u2019s plot to blow up the ship.\nThis fifth installment in the series features Marjorie Woodworth as love interest Phyllis Arden, Frank Faylen (now playing seaman Jenkins) and Minor Watson as Captain Scott.\n\u00a0\nHere Comes Trouble (1948, 50 min.)Now civilians, police reporter Doubleday and police officer Ames set their sights on busting up an organized crime ring that\u2019s terrorizing the city.\nThis first and only Cinecolor entry in the series, Here Comes Trouble is silent film star Betty Compson\u2019s final credited role.

These timeless shorts showcase the incredible comedic talents of an unsung duo who simply wanted to make audiences laugh... and succeeded!\n\u00a0\nIn Hollywood, the laugh factory operated by Roach was known to one and all as \"The Lot of Fun.\" Established in 1915, the studio hosted many of the familiar names in comedy at one time or another: Harold Lloyd, Charley Chase and the popular and iconic team of Laurel and Hardy. \u00ad\nDetermined to find the female equivalent of \"The Boys,\" Roach paired Thelma Todd (already under contract and a veteran of several Chase shorts) with comic actress ZaSu Pitts. Thelma and ZaSu appeared in 17 shorts between 1931 and 1933 that were very popular with moviegoers, but their fruitful partnership ended when Pitts and Roach failed to come to terms on a new contract.\n\u00a0\nAfter seeing comedienne Patsy Kelly in the stage production of Flying Colors, Roach agreed that she was the perfect replacement for ZaSu, and the new team of Todd-Kelly was soon putting out hilarious efforts like Babes in the Goods (1934), Maid in Hollywood (1934) and Top Flat (1935). All-American Toothache (1936) would be their final pairing as Todd's tragic death brought an end to the girls' entertaining partnership.\n\u00a0\nThough efforts were made to jump-start the franchise with Pert Kelton and Lyda Roberti, the writing was on the wall where Roach's two-reelers were concerned as the producer soon transitioned solely to \"streamliners\" and feature films.\n\u00a0\nDISC 1Beauty and the Bus (1933, 17:21) - The girls win a new car and take it out for a spin.

        "name": "Douglas Fairbanks: A Modern Musketeer (DVD)",
        "description": "\nWinner of the 2009 Il Cinema Ritrovato DVD Award, Douglas Fairbanks: A Modern Musketeer includes eleven of the joyful modern-dress comedies, westerns, satires, dream-fantasies and romances which, though mostly seldom-seen, made Fairbanks a tremendously popular hero. In addition to Fairbanks's unique talent, these ebullient films showcase his gifted collaborators including writer Anita Loos and directors Allan Dwan, Victor Fleming, and John Emerson.\nDouglas Fairbanks came from Broadway to the movies in 1915 when high salaries were luring well-known stage actors to the new feature-length pictures. Although most of these performers failed to \u201cregister\u201d on camera and returned to New York, Fairbanks quickly became a supernova. His energetic, optimistic character, his ingratiating smile, his graceful, acrobatic stunts (he did his own), clever writing, and accomplished staging rapidly made Fairbanks one of the most admired stars in the world.\nDouglas Fairbanks: A Modern Musketeer begins with 4 films from 1916 by Triangle-Fine Arts: His Picture in the Papers, The Mystery of the Leaping Fish, Flirting With Fate, and The Matrimaniac. The collection continues with 3 films produced by Fairbanks for Artcraft/Famous Players-Lasky Corp.: Wild and Woolly (1917), Reaching for the Moon (1917), and A Modern Musketeer (1918). The last are 4 features Fairbanks produced for United Artists, a company he established in 1917 with Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford and D. W. Griffith: When the Clouds Roll By (1919), The Mollycoddle (1920), The Mark of Zorro (1920), and The Nut (1921).\"\n",

        "description": "Miss Mend, an action-packed adventure serial in three feature-length episodes, was produced in Russia with the goal of rivaling, and possibly even surpassing, the most entertaining American movies of the 1920s. Instead of the avant-garde works of Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, Russian audiences were enchanted by fast-moving American films starring serial queens like Pearl White, swashbuckling heroes like Douglas Fairbanks, and comedians from the Keystone Cops to Lloyd, Keaton and Chaplin. Miss Mend meets them all head-on and hardly stops for breath. It features beautiful location photography, impressive stunt scenes; horse, car and boat chases, radio towers, jazz bands and even a spectacular train wreck, interspersed with visual references to German film classics like Nosferatu, Caligari and Dr. Mabuse, The film\u2019s heroine, Vivian Mend, is an elegant urban professional who earns her own living and raises a child without the help of any man. But the film, partially set in an imagined America where everything is new and progressive (from technology to social relations and lifestyles) also includes a few more-than-pointed comments on labor relations, racism, excessive wealth, gratuitous violence and even rape.

Transposing the action of the perennial stage farce from 1851 to a summer wedding day in 1895 \u2013 the birth of cinema \u2013 Clair recalls detail, costume and design captured by the first movies. The Italian Straw Hat (Un Chapeau de paille d\u2019Italie) triumphantly survives its 1927 journey from stage to screen; a dozen eccentric characters, superbly acted, try desperately to keep up appearances in the face of disaster, their attitudes, concerns and gestures exquisitely stylized under Clair\u2019s deft orchestration. The sets and costumes, too, are a charming combination of the suffocating and the exact.\nA bridegroom is riding to his marriage when his horse eats a straw hat hanging on a branch while its owner, a married lady, enjoys a tryst behind the bush with her love, a fierce hussar. She cannot go home without her hat, so the groom interlaces his wedding with an attempt to find madam a twin chapeau, launching a series of misunderstandings and embarrassments. The Italian Straw Hat has few cinematic equals and inspired Pauline Kael to observe \"One of the funniest films ever made... so expertly timed and choreographed that farce becomes ballet.\"\nThis is the only fully complete edition of The Italian Straw Hat ever available to American viewers. The film was mastered in high definition at 19 frames per second from the original 35mm negative used for the English release in 1930. As that version had been subjected to about twenty edits, all the missing pieces were restored from an original French print. Intertitles are in English, with optional subtitles of the original French text. There is a choice of two new accompaniments, one by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra and the other by pianist Philip Carli, each providing a unique interpretation on this delightful film.\n",
