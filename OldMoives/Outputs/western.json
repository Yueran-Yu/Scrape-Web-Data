Unaware of the peril brought about by their presumed identities, Melody and George get a little help from Cherry De Longpre who\u2019s eager to get them out of town ahead of an anxious posse.\u00a0 Cherry\u2019s motives aren\u2019t entirely pure, however, as she hopes her scheme will ensure the successful escape of her wounded boyfriend -- none other than the Monte Jarrad himself. But Melody becomes wise to Cherry\u2019s plotting and uses the situation to his advantage by trying to capture Jarrad, gain the reward and fame, all the while trying to escape the long arm of the law.\nAn actor who always rode tall in the saddle, Gary Cooper spoofs his laconic cowpoke image in Along Came Jones, playing an unconventional cowboy who can\u2019t even shoot straight! Loretta Young co-stars as Cherry, with William Demarest as Coop\u2019s loyal sidekick and Dan Duryea as the villainous Jarrad.\u00a0 Based on the 1943 novel The Useless Cowboy by Alan Le May, Jones has great fun with the conventional movie Western, bolstered by an amusing script courtesy of Nunnally Johnson (who wrote Cooper\u2019s previous Casanova Brown). Directed by Stuart Heisler (The Glass Key), this sprightly comedy-western was the only time the Oscar\u00ae winning Cooper added \u201cproducer\u201d to his lengthy list of classic movie credits.\n",

In addition to Fairbanks's unique talent, these ebullient films showcase his gifted collaborators including writer Anita Loos and directors Allan Dwan, Victor Fleming, and John Emerson.\nDouglas Fairbanks came from Broadway to the movies in 1915 when high salaries were luring well-known stage actors to the new feature-length pictures. Although most of these performers failed to \u201cregister\u201d on camera and returned to New York, Fairbanks quickly became a supernova. His energetic, optimistic character, his ingratiating smile, his graceful, acrobatic stunts (he did his own), clever writing, and accomplished staging rapidly made Fairbanks one of the most admired stars in the world.\nDouglas Fairbanks: A Modern Musketeer begins with 4 films from 1916 by Triangle-Fine Arts: His Picture in the Papers, The Mystery of the Leaping Fish, Flirting With Fate, and The Matrimaniac. The collection continues with 3 films produced by Fairbanks for Artcraft/Famous Players-Lasky Corp.: Wild and Woolly (1917), Reaching for the Moon (1917), and A Modern Musketeer (1918). The last are 4 features Fairbanks produced for United Artists, a company he established in 1917 with Charles Chaplin, Mary Pickford and D. W. Griffith: When the Clouds Roll By (1919), The Mollycoddle (1920), The Mark of Zorro (1920), and The Nut (1921).\"\n",
