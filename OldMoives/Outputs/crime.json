        "description": "\n\u00a0\nLocked away for decades, all five Michael Shayne films made at PRC Studios are making their DVD debut in this special collection from ClassicFlix! Lloyd Nolan starred as Private Detective Michael Shayne in seven features made at 20th Century-Fox in the early 1940s. After the major studio dropped the series, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) brought Brett Halliday\u2019s ace crime-solver over to \u201cPoverty Row\u201d in 1946 for these five fun, action-packed whodunnits starring Hugh Beaumont (Leave It to Beaver) as the famed fictional detective. Whether you're a fan of Brett Halliday, B-mysteries or Hugh Beaumont, The Complete PRC Michael Shayne Mystery Collection delivers the goods with over five hours of crime-solving excitement that will keep you guessing until the very end.\n\u00a0\nMurder Is My Business (1946, 64 min.)When a former hood and acquaintance of Michael Shayne is found dead alongside a wealthy client, the private eye looks to stay one step ahead of Chief Detective Pete Rafferty, who wants to implicate Shayne in the crime.\nThis clever mystery sets the pace well for the remainder of the series and co-stars Cheryl Walker in her first of three turns as the loyal and longing Phyllis Hamilton. Also featuring Ralph Dunn, Lyle Talbot, George Meeker and Virginia Christine.\n\u00a0\nLarceny in Her Heart (1946, 68 min.)A desperate step-father pleads with Michael Shayne to find his missing step-daughter, and after clues start piling up, the detective goes undercover in a sanitarium in an attempt to solve the case.\nCheryl Walker is back again as \u201cPhil\u201d and Paul Bryar makes his first of three appearances as reporter and sidekick Tim Rourke. Also featuring Ralph Dunn, Douglas Fowley, Charles C. Wilson and Marie Harmon.\n\u00a0\nBlonde for a Day (1946, 66 min.)Michael Shayne has relocated to San Francisco, but returns to Los Angeles when he learns that reporter Tim Rourke is near death after being shot for getting too close to solving three murders tied to a gambling syndicate which uses a blonde to do its dirty work.\nKathryn Adams (real-life Mrs. Hugh Beaumont at the time) played Phyllis Hamilton for the first and only time and retired from acting after this film. Also featuring Cy Kendall (as Inspector Rafferty), Paul Bryar, Charles C. Wilson and Frank Ferguson.\n\u00a0\nThree on a Ticket (1947, 62 min.)A man drops dead in his office, a woman asks him to bump off her husband and two mugs jump and beat him unconscious. It\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for Detective Michael Shayne who tries to piece together the mystery of what makes a baggage check ticket so valuable that it\u2019s worth committing murder.\nCheryl Walker and Ralph Dunn are back in their respective roles of \u201cPhil\u201d and Inspector Rafferty while Paul Bryar takes his third and final turn as Tim Rourke. Also featuring Louise Currie, Douglas Fowley and Gavin Gordon.\n\u00a0\nToo Many Winners (1947, 60 min.)When too many winning tickets are claimed at Santa Rosita Race Track, everybody\u2019s target is Michael Shayne: the curvaceous tipster who won\u2019t take no for an answer, the shady operator who offers him dough to lay off and the criminal mastermind whose thugs tangle with the sly detective at every turn. Hugh Beaumont\u2019s last appearance as Brett Halliday\u2019s wisecracking crime-solver co-stars Trudy Marshall as Phyllis Hamilton, and also features Ralph Dunn, Claire Carleton, John Hamilton, Grandon Rhodes, Ben Welden and Byron Foulger.\n",

Instead of the avant-garde works of Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, Russian audiences were enchanted by fast-moving American films starring serial queens like Pearl White, swashbuckling heroes like Douglas Fairbanks, and comedians from the Keystone Cops to Lloyd, Keaton and Chaplin. Miss Mend meets them all head-on and hardly stops for breath. It features beautiful location photography, impressive stunt scenes; horse, car and boat chases, radio towers, jazz bands and even a spectacular train wreck, interspersed with visual references to German film classics like Nosferatu, Caligari and Dr. Mabuse, The film\u2019s heroine, Vivian Mend, is an elegant urban professional who earns her own living and raises a child without the help of any man. But the film, partially set in an imagined America where everything is new and progressive (from technology to social relations and lifestyles) also includes a few more-than-pointed comments on labor relations, racism, excessive wealth, gratuitous violence and even rape.

        "description": "\nFor the first time on home video come all 26 episodes of the first season of Public Defender starring Reed Hadley as Bart Matthews: a tireless and dedicated public servant, who earnestly defends the rights of the indigent.\n\u00a0\nA late season replacement for Philip Morris Playhouse, Public Defender premiered in March 1954, a time when the concept of a taxpayer funded defense attorney was largely associated with capital cases. But with everyday stories based on real-life events, tackling every kind of thorny dilemma from juvenile delinquency to vehicular homicide, the series not only shed new light on this little known public office, but its attention to realistic detail made the show a key player in the history of television crime drama.\n\u00a0\nProduced by Hal Roach, Jr., Public Defender gave Reed Hadley the second of two small screen successes (the other being the similar-in-tone Racket Squad) and also provided a great showcase for directors like Budd Boetticher and Erle C. Kenton.\nThis 3-disc collection marks the first official home video release of this popular anthology series, with all 26 first season episodes culled from original Hal Roach Studio masters.\n\u00a0\nGuest stars from the golden age of both film and TV pack each episode, with Hugh Beaumont, Marie Windsor, James Gleason, Steve Brodie, Lyle Talbot, Adele Jergens, Jimmy Lydon, Mary Beth Hughes, John Qualen, Darryl Hickman, Harry Carey, Jr., Harold Peary, Alan Reed, Noel Neill, Glenn Langan and Barbara Whiting, among many more, making an appearance.\n\u00a0\n\nStarring:\u00a0Reed Hadley, Hugh Beaumont, Marie Windsor, James Gleason, Steve Brodie, Lyle Talbot, Adele Jergens, Jimmy Lydon, Mary Beth Hughes, John Qualen, Darryl Hickman, Harry Carey Jr., Harold Peary, Alan Reed, Noel Neill, Glenn Langan, Barbara Whiting\nDirected By:\u00a0Budd Boetticher, Erle C.

Thanks to the efforts of the Film Noir Foundation, this terrific 1950 film noir, the only American print of which was burned in a 2008 fire, has been rescued and restored to its original luster. Join the wild chase around San Francisco as a man goes into hiding after witnessing a gangland execution. Police bird-dog his wife Eleanor (Ann Sheridan), certain she\u2019ll lead them to her husband, whose testimony against the killer could bring down a crime kingpin.

When roguish newspaperman Danny Leggett (Dennis O\u2019Keefe) charms Eleanor into helping him track down the hidden husband\u2014there are unexpected, stunning, and poignant results. This nervy, shot-on-location thriller is a witty and wise look at the travails of romance and marriage, and perhaps the best cinematic depiction ever of mid-20th century San Francisco.
