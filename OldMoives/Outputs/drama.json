        "description": "Adapting John O\u2019Hara\u2019s incisive 1956 National Book Award winner, writer/director Philip Dunne delivers in Ten North Frederick (1958) an intelligent and poignantly adult drama of blighted ambition, family dysfunction and second chances. The peerless Gary Cooper plays Joe Chapin, a small-town, patrician lawyer of innate decency wed to a cold, unloving wife (Geraldine Fitzgerald), who is wrongly pushed into politics and seeks solace in a rejuvenating romance with a younger woman (Suzy Parker). Diane Varsi, Ray Stricklyn, Tom Tully and Stuart Whitman comprise the effective ensemble cast. Superbly lensed by Joe MacDonald and scored by Leigh Harline.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

The 10-episode Films Albatros serial is a six-and-a-half-hour epic of stylish elegance and narrative imagination.\nOn DVD for the 1st time in this 3-Disc DVD Edition!\nSerial films, or cin\u00e9 romans were well-established in France before World War I where they are most closely identified with writer-director Louis Feuillade. These melodramas for adult audiences were unlike American serials that were targeted primarily at youngsters. At Albatros, Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 producer Joseph Ermolieff produced three serials in 1921, all adapted from roman-feuilletons by the phenomenally successful Jules Mary, a specialist in the genre, who penned many a famous melodrama around the theme of the miscarriage of justice - a theme that must have had special appeal for the unjustly displaced technicians and artists of Ermolieff's Moscow and Yalta studios.\nThe first two serials have not left a trace in the annals of film archives. But The House of Mystery (La Maison du myst\u00e8re), Ermolieff's third serial, (begun in the summer of 1921 and not completed until 1923) by Alexandre Volkoff (with fellow studio director Viatcheslav Tourjansky providing some important and uncredited second-unit work), is a triumph of the genre and a complete delight that not only survived, but also was restored in its original ten-episode format by the Cinematheque Francaise. Flicker Alley and the Blackhawk Films\u00ae Collection are proud to present for the first time on DVD this six-and-a-half-hour epic of stylish elegance and narrative imagination, with optional English subtitles by Lenny Borger and a brand-new score by composer Neil Brand.\nThe involved plot of La Maison du myst\u00e8re centers around Julien Villandrit (Ivan Mosjoukine) and his star-crossed courtship to R\u00e9gine de Bettigny (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darly), that inspires bitterness and jealousy in Henri Corradin (Charles Vanel), Julien's long-time associate and secret rival in love. For Mosjoukine, who contracted typhoid fever during the course of production, it remains one of the ultimate consecrations to his multifarious talents as actor, writer, and even make-up artist. But the film also opened doors for Vanel (Les Mis\u00e9rables, The Wages of Fear, Diabolique) who gives the \"\"Curses! Foiled again!\"\" school of melodramatic villainy a new lease on life), and the astonishing Nicolas Koline.\n",

        "description": "\nJ'Accuse, Abel Gance\u2019s extraordinary breakthrough work, is a World War I drama considered to be one of the most technically advanced films of the era and the first major pacifist film. It was referred to by Gance as \u201cA human cry against the bellicose din of armies.\u201d It stars Marise Dauvray as Edith, a woman who is unhappily married to an older man, Fran\u00e7ois (S\u00e9verin-Mars), but is actually in love with a young poet, Jean Diaz (Romuald Joub\u00e9). Both Jean and Fran\u00e7ois end up on the front lines of World War I while Edith is captured by German forces and suffers atrocities at the hands of the soldiers. Gance contrasts individual human suffering with the larger horrors of war, depicted with stark realism.\nJ\u2019Accuse introduced such technical advances as rapid-cut editing and highly expressive camerawork and lighting. Gance, who had served briefly in the military, returned to active service in order to film real battle scenes to include in the project. The film became a huge international hit, prompting one journalist to write that if the film had been shown in every town in the world in 1913, war might have been averted. In the early 1920s, Gance revised the plot, titles, and editing for \u201cpeacetime\u201d presentation. That had been the only version of the film available until now. This new French-titled, tinted 2-DVD edition is a reconstruction of the film\u2019s original 1919 montage. It contains many original art cards with optional English subtitles by film historian Lenny Borger, and features a new symphonic score by Robert Israel. Experience once again what film historian Georges Sadoul called \u201ca fevered, monumental epic on the terrible wastage of war.\u201d\n",

The film also boasts famous stylized sets designed by Alberto Cavalcanti and Lazare Meerson, seen here to best advantage in a stunning tinted and toned print restored by the Cin\u00e9matheque Fran\u00e7aise, and accompanied by a beautiful large-orchestra score composed and conducted by Timothy Brock.\nMathias, an eccentric dreamer, is trapped in the undertakings of daily life as he suffers his days in a loveless marriage, a dead end job and tyrannized by his ungrateful mother-in-law. Grief-stricken by the death of his mother and infant daughter, Mathias flees to Monte Carlo, where a run of luck at roulette wins him a fortune. After his death is falsely reported, Mathias leaps at the chance of a second and adventurous life in Rome. Both tragedy and comedy, The Late Mathias Pascal explores the struggles and possibilities of a man in search of happiness in L\u2019Herbier\u2019s most celebrated film.\nCritic David Melville wrote: \u201cThe White Russian exile Ivan Mosjoukine was arguably the greatest male star of the silent screen. Imagine an actor who combined the matin\u00e9e idol looks of John Barrymore with the smoldering sexual magnetism of Valentino, the deft physical comedy of Chaplin with the dark Gothic creepiness of Lon Chaney. It sounds impossible, of course - unless you've seen Mosjoukine in action.\u201d\nThis is a co-production of L\u2019Herbier\u2019s Cinegraphic company, and Alexandre Kamenka\u2019s Films Albatros, the Parisian home of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian screen colony and maker of many of the most prestigious films of the decade. L\u2019Herbier at this time was among cinema\u2019s leading avant-garde directors, the equal of Fritz Lang, Abel Gance and Erich von Stroheim, and The Late Mathias Pascal is considered one of his best films, full of picturesque tricks, \u201cspiritual\u201d angles, and dream sequences as it passes from rural chamber-film to burlesque fantasy, with an incursion into expressionist comedy of manners.\"\n",

        "description": "\nThis two-disc DVD set features The Italian (1915) and Traffic in Souls (1913), two riveting and important social dramas of the American silent screen from the earliest years of feature-length cinema, when movies were more dedicated to advocacy and reform than to escapist entertainment. First released near the end of a long period of unrestricted emigration from Europe to the United States, these two films depict new immigrants to America and the hazards that await them. Both are honored with inclusion in The National Film Registry (which selects up to twenty-five \u201cculturally, historically or aesthetically significant films\u201d each year). In addition to the features, this set presents three theme-related bonus films from the pioneer Edison company: Police Force, New York City (1910), The Call of the City (1912), and McQuade of the Traffic Squad (1915).\nThe Italian, produced for Paramount Pictures by Thomas H. Ince and directed by Reginald Barker, stars George Beban, who was renowned for his ethnic characterizations. It is the story of Beppo, a gondolier who comes to America and settles in lower Manhattan, where he operates a shoeshine business and eventually saves enough money to import his fianc\u00e9e. Crime and poverty soon impact their lives \u2013 and there is no artificial, happy ending. Conflated from three sources, this tinted edition is mostly copied from an original nitrate print, and has an optional scene-specific audio essay by Prof. Giorgio Bertellini. A compiled score of authentic photoplay music is performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra led by Rodney Sauer, who also provides the music for the three Edison shorts.\nAccording to legend, Traffic in Souls was produced surreptitiously at Universal Pictures Corp. with the producer (Jack Cohn) and director (George Loane Tucker) prepared to buy the picture in case the company wouldn\u2019t release it. Exploiting a recent expos\u00e9 of prostitution rings, this \u201cwhite slavery\u201d story proved a huge financial success. Traffic in Souls is a very accomplished work for its time, and makes excellent use of New York City locations. This edition is copied from the only known original nitrate print of the domestic release; there is an excellent piano score by Philip Carli and an illuminating optional scene-specific audio essay by Professor Shelley Stamp, author of Movie-Struck Girls: Women and Motion Picture Culture After the Nickelodeon (Princeton Univ. Press).\n",

Higgins (He Walked by Night) and co-writer Leopold Atlas offer a taut, suspenseful tale of one man\u2019s desperate bid for freedom and the two women who love him.\nDennis O\u2019Keefe, star of the earlier T-Men, contributes a first-rate performance as the determined Joe, with Marsha Hunt (Pride and Prejudice) as Ann and Oscar\u00ae winning actress Claire Trevor (Key Largo) as the fiercely loyal Pat. Raw Deal also features a suitably slimy Raymond Burr as Rick, John Ireland as Burr\u2019s sadistic henchman Fantail, and noir standbys Regis Toomey and Whit Bissell. Raw Deal is film noir at its finest!\n",

        "description": "Edna O\u2019Brien adapted her own novel for X, Y and Zee (1972), a campy soap opera starring Elizabeth Taylor, Michael Caine, and Susannah York as the three points of a triangle that has very little to do with love. Taylor\u2019s a sharp-tongued vulgarian, determined to break up her architect husband\u2019s latest affair, even if it means seducing his mistress herself. Director Brian G. Hutton coaxes out every bit of sophisticated/smartypants humor his trio of superb stars can provide; cinematographer Billy Williams and composer Stanley Myers bring on the gloss.",
